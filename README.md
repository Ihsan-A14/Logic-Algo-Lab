🧪 Logic-Algo-Lab

💡 The Problem
    Computer Science students often struggle to connect the dots between low-level hardware logic (Boolean algebra, logic gates) and high-level software algorithms (sorting, searching). These concepts are usually taught in separate classes with static textbooks, making it hard to visualize how a computer actually processes information from the ground up.

🚀 The Solution
    Logic-Algo-Lab is an interactive, all-in-one educational suite that bridges this gap. It provides a visual "workbench" where students can:

    Build & Simplify Logic: Input raw boolean expressions to instantly generate Truth Tables and visualize circuits.

    Visualize Algorithms: Watch sorting and searching algorithms manipulate data in real-time to understand how they work, not just that they work.

    By combining these domains, Logic-Algo-Lab serves as a comprehensive "CS Tutor" that is free, accessible, and interactive.

✨ Key Features
    🛠️ Module 1: The Logic Lab (Hardware)

        Truth Table Generator: Instantly parses complex boolean expressions (e.g., (A + B) * C) and generates a formatted Truth Table.

        Logic Simplifier: Uses the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to minimize boolean expressions, showing students the most efficient hardware implementation.

        Circuit Renderer: Dynamically draws the logic gates corresponding to the user's input, helping students visualize the physical hardware.

    📊 Module 2: The Algorithm Arena (Software)

        Sorting Visualizer: Implements Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.

        Visuals: Bars change color to distinguish between comparison (evaluating) and swapping (memory operation), making the internal logic visible.

        Searching Visualizer:

        Linear Search: Scans elements sequentially to find a target.

        Binary Search: Visually "cuts" the array in half, graying out discarded sections to demonstrate O(logn) efficiency.

        Educational Constraint: The UI enforces that Binary Search only works on sorted data, reinforcing a critical CS concept
